\section{Split Popn Cox Overrep Failure}

\subsection{Likelihood function}

\noindent Recall from Ben's "Parametric Zombie Survival Model" that the
probability of misclassification (that is, subset of non-censured failure
outcomes that are being misclassified) is%
\begin{equation}
\alpha =\Pr (C_{i}=1|\widetilde{C}_{i}=0)
\end{equation}

The unconditional density is thus given by the combination of an
observation's misclassification probability and its probability of
experiencing an actual failure conditional on not being misclassified,%
\begin{equation}
\alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha _{i})\ast f(t_{i})
\end{equation}

And the unconditional survival function is therefore%
\begin{equation}
(1-\alpha _{i})\ast S(t_{i})
\end{equation}

where%
\begin{equation}
\alpha _{i}=\frac{\exp (\mathbf{Z}\gamma )}{1+\exp (\mathbf{Z}\gamma )}
\end{equation}

The likeihood function of the Parametric Zombie Survival Model is from
equation 7 in Ben's document is defined as 
\begin{equation}
L=\dprod\limits_{i=1}^{N}[\alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha _{i})f(t_{i}|X,\beta
)]^{C_{i}}[(1-\alpha _{i})S(t_{i}|\mathbf{X,}\beta )]^{1-C_{i}}
\end{equation}

And the log likelihood is%
\begin{equation}
L=\dsum\limits_{i=1}^{N}\{C_{i}\ln [\alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha
_{i})f(t_{i}|X,\beta )]+(1-C_{i})\ln [(1-\alpha _{i})S(t_{i}|\mathbf{X,}%
\beta )]
\end{equation}

\bigskip We extend these definitions and notation from the Parametric Zombie
Survival Model to the Cox PH framework. To this end, first note that the
conditional hazard function in the Cox PH model in this case is 
\begin{equation}
h(t|\mathbf{X)}=h_{0}(t)e^{\mathbf{X}\beta }
\end{equation}

where $h_{0}(t)$ is the unknown baseline hazard hazard function. Using
equation (4), the description of $\emph{\alpha }_{i}$ and the survival
function, failure density and the conditional hazard function (see equation
6) of the Cox model, we can define the likelihood function of the split popn
Cox-Overrep Failure (OF) model as follows,%
\begin{equation}
L=\dprod\limits_{i=1}^{N}\left[ \alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha _{i})h_{0}(t_{i})e^{%
\mathbf{X}\beta }\exp \left\{ -\exp (\mathbf{X}\beta
)\dint\nolimits_{0}^{t_{i}}h_{0}(u)du\right\} \right] ^{C_{i}}\left[
(1-\alpha _{i})\exp \left\{ -\exp (\mathbf{X}\beta
)\dint\nolimits_{0}^{t_{i}}h_{0}(u)du\right\} \right] ^{1-C_{i}}
\end{equation}%
The log-likelihood from this expression is%
\begin{equation}
\ln L=\dsum\limits_{i=1}^{N}\left( C_{i}\ln \left[ \alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha
_{i})h_{0}(t_{i})e^{\mathbf{X}\beta }\exp \left\{ -\exp (\mathbf{X}\beta
)\dint\nolimits_{0}^{t_{i}}h_{0}(u)du\right\} \right] \right) +\left(
(1-C_{i})\ln \left[ (1-\alpha _{i})\exp \left\{ -\exp (\mathbf{X}\beta
)\dint\nolimits_{0}^{t_{i}}h_{0}(u)du\right\} \right] \right) 
\end{equation}

where $\dint\nolimits_{0}^{t_{i}}h_{0}(u)du$ is the cumulative baseline
hazard function that can be estimated by a non-parametic step function. To
see this, let $u_{0}<u_{1}<....u_{k}$ denote the distinct uncensored
observations. If the baseline hazard is constant between these values, then
an estimator for the baseline hazard can be defined as%
\begin{equation}
\dint\nolimits_{0}^{t_{i}}\widehat{h}_{0}(u)du=\dsum%
\limits_{j=1}^{k}H_{j}I(u_{j}\leq t)
\end{equation}%
To simplify notation, let $\Lambda
(t)=\dsum\limits_{j=1}^{k}H_{j}I(u_{j}\leq t)$. Then the likelihood in (8)
can be written as%
\begin{equation}
L=\dprod\limits_{i=1}^{N}\left[ \alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha _{i})h_{0}(t_{i})e^{%
\mathbf{X}\beta }\exp \left\{ -e^{\mathbf{X}\beta }\Lambda (t)\right\} %
\right] ^{C_{i}}\left[ (1-\alpha _{i})\exp \left\{ -e^{\mathbf{X}\beta
}\Lambda (t)\right\} \right] ^{1-C_{i}}
\end{equation}%
And the corresponding log likelihood as%
\begin{equation}
\ln L=\dprod\limits_{i=1}^{N}\left( C_{i}\ln \left[ \alpha _{i}+(1-\alpha
_{i})h_{0}(t_{i})e^{\mathbf{X}\beta }\exp \left\{ -e^{\mathbf{X}\beta
}\Lambda (t)\right\} \right] \right) +\left( (1-C_{i})\ln \left[ (1-\alpha
_{i})\exp \left\{ -e^{\mathbf{X}\beta }\Lambda (t)\right\} \right] \right) 
\end{equation}

While these likelihood and log-likelihood expressions look complicated,it
should be(in theory)relatively easy to estimate using logit for $\alpha $
and separately fitting a Cox PH model for the survival part.

Finally, the following is clearly not necessary for the paper -- but I think
(am not sure about this), the integral in the contribution of either the
censored \textit{or }uncensored observations in the likelihood and thus
log-likelihood function can be treated as zero. If so, then the expression
for the full log likelihood function can be fully derived and written
completely more easily after making the necessary substitutions and taking
logs. *If* this can be done mathematically, then I can try to differentiate
the fully defined log likelihood, solve the score equations and define the
"profile likelihood" that only depends on the parameters $\gamma $ and $%
\beta $. This will allow us to study the full profile likelihood that in any
case will (likely) confirm using logit for $\alpha $ and separately fitting
a Cox PH model for the survival part. And this in effect means that standard
conclusions from asymptotic theory can be used (or cited) from the logit and
Cox PH model to demonstrate that the parameter estimates from the split popn
Cox-overrep failure are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed.
